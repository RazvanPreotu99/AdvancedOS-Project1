Submission files are Node.java, NodeThread.java, IDSocket.java, NodeStruct.java, and NodeID.java.
It is necessary to use our submitted NodeID.java as we implemented toString() for the class.
A sample Main.java is provided just in case.

To compile the files on dcxx machines:
1. move to the directory with all the source files
2. run javac Main.java

To run the project on dcxx machines using our Main.java:
1. run java Main <nodeID> <path to config file> in the same directory as before
2. repeat on different machines depending on number of hosts in config.txt
